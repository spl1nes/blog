## What is personal data?

Personal data is information that can be used to find out personal or factual circumstances about you (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address). Information for which we cannot (or can only with a disproportionate effort) establish a relationship to your person, e.g. by anonymizing the information, is not personal data.

## What personal data do we collect/process and use?

Access data without personal reference is stored, such as the name of your Internet service provider, the page from which you visit us, the names of the requested files and their retrieval date. These data are evaluated exclusively for the improvement of our offer and do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person.

If you wish to make use of services offered by us on our website, such as the purchase of APPLICATIONS, etc., it is necessary, on the other hand, for you to provide further data for this purpose. This is the data that is required for the respective processing, e.g. the e-mail address when ordering a SERVICE or APPLICATION.
We use the data we collect about you to provide the products and SERVICES we offer, to answer your questions and to operate and improve our websites and APPLICATION.

No further use of your personal data will take place. A transfer of your personal data to third parties or a use of your data for advertising purposes without your consent will not take place, except for the cases described below, unless we are required by law to disclose data (information to law enforcement agencies and courts; information to public bodies that receive data under statutory provisions, e.g. social security agencies, tax authorities, etc.) or that we involve third parties to enforce our claims. In particular, personal data is used as follows:

* When you register with jingga, we first store your e-mail address so that we can send you new access data in case you forget it. In addition, we store your first and last name as well as your password to enable you to log in to your account conveniently. These data are used by us for the purposes described above in order to offer you this service.
* If you make use of the possibility to send inquiries to us by means of our contact form, we will ask you for your name and e-mail address. Furthermore, you can enter your individual message to us in the message field. It is your free decision whether you provide us with this data. However, we cannot fulfill your contact request without this information.

## Changes to these Terms

We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these TERMS at any time. If a revision is material We will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use Our SERVICE after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the WEBSITE and the SERVICE.
