## Summary

The business documentation includes various documents which can be helpful to setup a startup, implement processes, Risk Management etc. The documents are created with a very strong focus on a IT company. Nevertheless, the documentation can be easily modified and expanded to fit many different company types and industries.

### Style and dependencies

The documents are created with the Software called Typora, and use the Markdown text standard with some additional extensions. The advantage of this text format is that it is very easy to track changes to the documents in version control software. Of course you can also copy the contents and paste them into your software of choice (e.g. Word, Notes, Intranet, etc.).

### Updates

We intend to expand and improve the documentation over time but please note that you will have to manually check if any interesting changes and expansions were performed by yourself. Please note that the documentation also contains very organization specific documents for the jingga organization. These documents are most likely not helpful for your business case but can provide a good inspiration how to improve or implement your own business documentations.
