## Summary

The OCR Image Optimizer is a command line tool for optimizing badly scanned or photographed documents for better OCR performance on Windows.

Optimization features include color changes to black and white, removing shadows, image rotation, removal of unneccessary areas and image sharpening. The software does not include a text recognition program (OCR).

## Scenarios

A user makes a photo of an invoice. The document in the image is slightly tilted and has some shadows which make it difficult for your OCR software to recognize (OCR software is not included). You run the OCR Image Optimizer and receive a improved image for better OCR results.

If you scan a document as PDF you need to convert this document form PDF to an image (this software is not included, you may use pdftoppm for example) before you pass this image as input to the optimizer.
