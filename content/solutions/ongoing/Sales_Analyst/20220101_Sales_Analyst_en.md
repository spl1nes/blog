## Summary

The Sales Analyst is a BI tool with fixed and pre-defined reports and analysis. The tool requires direct database access to the sales data in order to create a vast amount of automatic reports. The big advantage of this tool is that the user only defines the database tables and columns where the sales data can be found and from this point onward the tool can create the pre-defined reports live without much interaction.
