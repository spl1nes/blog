# Japanese SOX (J-SOX)

J-SOX is a standard for evaluating and auditing internal controls relevant for the financial reporting and creation of the financial statements. J-SOX is mandatory for all  stock traded companies and plays a very important role for the risk management. Depending on the size of the subsidiaries they may as well have to implement J-SOX regardless of their location.

1. Communication (effectiveness, efficiency)
2. Compliance (fraud, whistle blower system, dealing with misconduct)
3. Responsibilities and how they are ensured

## Audit

The audit for for J-SOX is usually two-fold. One audit is performed by the internal auditors who are independent from the finance department and audited processes. The second audit is performed by external auditors who do a re-performance test (testing some of the already tested documents by the internal auditing team) and independent tests. Either the internal audit takes place before the external audit or they may also take place during the same time. In some situations parts of the audits may be performed before the year-end giving the audited company some time to improve findings during the audit. However the finalization of the J-SOX audit is performed after the year-end for the past year.
