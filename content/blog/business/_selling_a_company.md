# Selling A Company

Many companies will arrive at the point where they want to or have to be sold to a new shareholder. Unless you are already in some negotiations with a potential investor you should contact a corporate finance company which offers transaction consultations. This consultant will guide you through the process of selling a company. Nevertheless in this article you will find some basic information about the sales process which will give you a rough idea about what is laying ahead.

While the whole sales process can be pretty fast you should expect a time frame of 6 month to 18 month.

## Negotiations With Corporate Finance Consultants

Before picking a consultant who will support you with the selling process you will have to interview a couple in order to compare their services and rates. Usually the compensation of the consultants is threefold:

1. A monthly fee (fixed rate)
2. A success fee (based on the sales price)
3. A overfulfillment fee (additional rate overfulfilling a certain sales price)

Additionally you will have to cover business expenses such as travel expenses for in-person meetings, market research data that may be required during the sales process etc.

## Exchange Of Information

After picking a consultant you will most likely be asked to provide certain information so that the consultant can get a better hold of your business. While this information exchange starts very early in the process don't expect the consultant to grasp every detail of your business and how you operate. You and the whole management team will always be the experts in terms of business knowledge and you will have to perform significant work during the whole sales process.

The information you will have to exchange with the consultants most likely will consist of:

* Financial data
* Sales data
* Marketing material
* Business plan / budget for the next 2-3 years
* Information about the employees (management team)
* Company history (founding, major stepping stones etc.)

## Long-List

Before addressing potential investors you have to identify them. For this reason a `long-list` is created with many potential investors. This list can easily contain 50 - 100 potential investors and is usually created by the consultant with some of your help (usually in terms of strategic investors). For these investors information such as location, size and business field as well as other significant investments should be included.

For easier management later on the consultant should split them into private equity, family offices and strategic investors because in some cases you may be more interested in one type of investor than in another. Additionally the consultant can also create a preliminary ranking (A, B, C, D) based on his own experience or information gathered during the meetings with the management team.

### Private Equity

Private equity companies usually hold investments for 3 - 7 years depending on their investment strategy which means that by choosing such an investor you have to be prepared to perform the sales process in a couple of years again. On the plus side the management team usually receives shares which yield a profit once the business is sold again. As a result private equity investors are often more interested in mid-term growth.

Private equity offices also introduce little risk in approaching as they have little advantage in getting to know your business model, sales channels, prices, financials, R&D projects or key employee names unless they already have a investment in a related company. 

### Family Offices

Family offices are somewhat similar to private equity investors in terms of risk. The holding period of them however is longer but at the same time the sales price on average is lower than selling to private equity or strategic investors. Family offices are more focused on mid- to long-term growth.

### Strategic Investors

Strategic investors have the highest risk of approaching since they may simply be interested in getting as much information from your business as possible including potential hiring of key employees. Of course these risks get reduced on paper through NDAs but in reality there is little protection and when approaching them you should be very careful at which information you should provide at which stage.

### Management Buyout (MBO)

Finally the management buyout where the management purchases the company. This may result in the lowest sales price but on the other hand is very secure for the company as management and company know each other very well with little room for large surprises. This type of investment however keeps the view of the company very limited where the other investors may provide valuable external input which can lead to significant growth.

## Short-List

The short-list is composed of the most promising candidates and should contain 10 - 30 candidates. These investors get approached by the consultants with a teaser.

## Teaser

The teaser is a short info leaflet which should be 1 - 2 pages containing anonymized information about the company. Information that should be included in the teaser are:

* Sales and gross profit (past 3 years and budgeted for next 2-3 years)
* EBIT and ebit margin (past 3 years and budget for next 2-3 years)
*
